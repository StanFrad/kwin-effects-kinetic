# kwin-effects-kinetic

frok https://github.com/gurrgur/kwin-effects-kinetic


KWin effects optimized for a smooth and snappy KDE Plasma experience. Based on the [original effects from KWin 5.25.5](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/tree/v5.25.5/src/effects).

Installation through Plasma Systemsettings
The plugins are available from within Plasma Systemsettings:

Systemsettings -> Window Management -> Workspace Effects -> Get New (translated from german to english, so actual naming might differ)

There you can search for "Kinetic" and the effects should appear.

Manual Installation
For manual installation you want to put the contents of this repository (the folders starting with kinetic_) into ~/.local/share/kwin/effects/.

The effects are not enabled automatically, so you have to go to Systemsettings -> Window Management -> Workspace Effects, disable the corresponding default plasma effects, and enable the kinetic variants of them.
